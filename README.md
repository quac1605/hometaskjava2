Project Description:

This project is a simple Java application that allows users to list cars based on different criteria, such as brand, model year, and price. The application uses object serialization to save the car list to a file, so that it can be loaded and used later.

Object Serialization:

The application uses object serialization to save the car list to a file. Object serialization is a process of converting an object into a stream of bytes, which can then be saved to a file or transmitted over a network.

To save the car list to a file, the application uses the ObjectOutputStream class. To load the car list from a file, the application uses the ObjectInputStream class.
